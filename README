At http://gpl.ea.com you can download some open-source packages in zip files.

Deep inside some of these zip files is C++ code for the EASTL library, a
replacement for the STL. I'm not sure if this is the complete library, but
it seems to have all of the fundamentals.

This github project only exists to offer up these files in a more convenient
way, under EA's original license.

To learn more about EASTL, go here:
